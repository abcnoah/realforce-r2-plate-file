# realforce-r2-plate-file
I made this reinforcement plate because I was annoyed by the rust forming.

Anyone who needs it, please take it and use it for production. 

The small(silver) screw holes are M2 in size, and the screw holes with pillars are probably M2.3, but I'm not entirely sure.
 - The diameter of the small(silver) screw's thread is 1.9mm, the spacing between the threads is 0.4mm, the total length of the screw is about 6.1mm, and the length of the threaded portion is approximately 4.6mm
 - The diameter of the black screw's thread is 2.2mm, the spacing between the threads is 0.4mm, the total length of the screw is 9.5mm, and the length of the threaded portion is approximately 7.8mm.

Please note that I haven't actually produced it yet, so some minor adjustments may be necessary. Please use it as a reference
